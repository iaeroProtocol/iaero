# Security Audit Report: PermalockVault V5

**Contract Address:** `0x9322A2155815CD636A16e66BEF717B1B848e3248`  
**Auditor:** Independent Security Review  
**Date:** September 2025
**Network:** Base Mainnet  

## Executive Summary

The PermalockVault V5 contract implements a permalocking mechanism for AERO tokens via veAERO NFTs, with a 5% protocol fee structure and dual-token emission system (iAERO and LIQ). The audit identified several critical issues in earlier versions that have been successfully mitigated in the deployed version.

## Critical Issues Identified & Mitigated

### 1. Reentrancy Vulnerability (FIXED)
**Original Issue:** State variables updated after external calls in deposit functions  
**Risk:** Potential reentrancy attacks allowing manipulation of accounting  
**Mitigation:** State updates moved before external calls (lines 229-230, 269-270)  
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

### 2. Emission Rate Overflow (FIXED)
**Original Issue:** Uncapped halvings could cause emission rate to become 0 after ~256 halvings  
**Risk:** Complete failure of LIQ emission system  
**Mitigation:** Added 100-halving cap in `calculateLIQAmount` (lines 411, 417)  
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

### 3. Gas Griefing Attack (FIXED)
**Original Issue:** Unbounded loop in `_mergeAllNFTs` function  
**Risk:** DoS attack by adding excessive NFTs making deposits impossibly expensive  
**Mitigation:** Added MAX_MERGES limit of 10 per operation (line 551)  
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

### 4. NFT Transfer Vulnerability (FIXED)
**Original Issue:** `executeNFTAction` allowed arbitrary calls including NFT transfers  
**Risk:** Authorized users could steal managed NFTs  
**Mitigation:** Strict selector whitelist allowing only merge/increase operations  
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

### 5. Silent Failure on LIQ Cap (FIXED)
**Original Issue:** Function silently returned when LIQ cap reached  
**Risk:** Users pay fees but receive no LIQ tokens  
**Mitigation:** Added explicit revert with clear error message (line 532)  
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

## Medium Severity Issues

### 1. Emergency Recovery Mechanism
**Risk:** Owner could abuse rescue mechanism  
**Mitigation:** 48-hour timelock, requires pause + emergency state, predefined safe address  
**Status:** ✅ ACCEPTABLE with proper governance

### 2. Centralization Risk
**Risk:** Owner has significant control  
**Mitigation:** Ownership transferred to multisig, time-locked operations  
**Status:** ✅ ACCEPTABLE with multisig

## Security Features Implemented

1. **Reentrancy Guards:** All external functions protected
2. **Access Control:** Role-based permissions with clear separation
3. **Pause Mechanism:** Emergency pause capability for incident response
4. **Input Validation:** Comprehensive checks on all user inputs
5. **Decimal Validation:** Ensures all tokens are 18 decimals
6. **NFT Intake Guards:** Prevents accidental NFT transfers
7. **Safe Math:** Solidity 0.8.24 built-in overflow protection

## Economic Security

1. **Supply Cap Enforcement:** LIQ minting respects 100M cap with proper distribution
2. **Fee Structure:** Immutable 5% protocol fee prevents manipulation
3. **Treasury Split:** 20% of LIQ emissions to treasury ensures sustainability
4. **Halving Mechanism:** Predictable emission schedule with overflow protection

## Operational Security

### Access Control Hierarchy
- **Owner:** Contract administration (multisig)
- **Keeper:** Maintenance operations only
- **Voting Manager:** Gauge voting delegation
- **Rewards Collector:** Protocol fee claiming

### Emergency Procedures
1. Pause mechanism for immediate response
2. 48-hour timelock for NFT rescue operations
3. Sweep functions for recovering stuck tokens (excluding protocol tokens)

## Testing Recommendations

1. Implement comprehensive unit tests for all functions
2. Conduct integration testing with veAERO
3. Perform gas optimization analysis
4. Execute formal verification of critical invariants

## Post-Deployment Requirements

- [x] Grant MINTER_ROLE on iAERO to vault
- [x] Grant MINTER_ROLE on LIQ to vault
- [x] Set keeper address
- [x] Set voting manager
- [ ] Set rescue safe address
- [ ] Deposit initial veNFT to establish primary
- [ ] Set rewards collector

## Conclusion

The PermalockVault V5 contract demonstrates robust security practices with all critical vulnerabilities from earlier versions successfully mitigated. The implementation follows established patterns for DeFi protocols with appropriate access controls, emergency mechanisms, and economic safeguards. The contract is suitable for production use following completion of remaining setup steps.

**Risk Rating:** LOW (with multisig governance)  
**Recommendation:** APPROVED for mainnet deployment
