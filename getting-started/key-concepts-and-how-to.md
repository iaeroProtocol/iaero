# Getting Started with iAERO

## What Problem Does iAERO Solve?

Aerodrome's veAERO model creates a dilemma: lock your AERO for up to 4 years to maximize voting rewards, or keep it liquid and earn nothing. Most users end up somewhere in between - locking for shorter periods and getting suboptimal rewards, or forgetting to vote and missing out entirely.

iAERO eliminates this trade-off by pooling user deposits into a protocol-managed vault that maintains maximum voting power while giving users liquid tokens they can trade anytime.

## How It Works: The 30-Second Version

1. **You deposit veAERO NFTs or AERO** into the vault
2. **Vault locks it permanently** in veAERO for maximum voting power
3. **You receive iAERO tokens** (95% of deposit after 5% fee)
4. **You receive bonus LIQ tokens** (governance/rewards token)
5. **Stake your iAERO** to earn 80% of all voting rewards
6. **Vault votes automatically** every week using optimal strategy
7. **Trade iAERO anytime** if you need liquidity

**Q: Can I get my AERO back?**
A: No, deposits are one-way. But you can sell iAERO on the open market anytime.

**Q: How often are rewards distributed?**
A: Weekly, after each voting epoch. Keepers harvest and distribute automatically.

**Q: Is there a lock period for staking?**
A: No! Stake and unstake iAERO instantly with no cooldown.

**Q: What happens to my voting power?**
A: It's pooled with everyone else's and voted optimally by the protocol.

## Risk Considerations

- **Price Risk**: iAERO may trade below intrinsic value
- **Centralization**: Voting controlled by protocol multisig
