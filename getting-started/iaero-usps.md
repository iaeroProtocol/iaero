# iAERO Protocol - Unique Selling Propositions

## Core Tagline
**"The veAERO Position That Pays You When Others Exit"**

---

## The 6 Core USPs

### 1. 🤖 Automated, Optimized Voting
**Tagline:** *"Set-it-and-forget-it veAERO that never misses a beat"*

**What it means:**
- Our algorithm votes optimally across all Aerodrome pools every single epoch
- ROI-maximized allocation based on bribes, fees, and strategic value
- 100% participation rate - never miss rewards due to forgetting to vote

**User benefit:**
- No weekly voting hassle
- Maximum returns from every epoch
- Professional-grade optimization you can't do manually

**Soundbite:** *"You sleep, we maximize. Every. Single. Week."*

---

### 2. 💰 One-Click Reward Management
**Tagline:** *"Your yield, your way - instantly"*

**What it means:**
- Convert ALL rewards to USDC with one click
- Or auto-compound everything back into iAERO
- No manual swapping through multiple tokens

**User benefit:**
- Cash out to stables when you need liquidity
- Maximize compounding when you're accumulating
- Save time and gas fees

**Soundbite:** *"One click. All rewards. USDC or compound. Done."*

---

### 3. 🔓 True Exit Liquidity
**Tagline:** *"Sell anytime, instantly, to the protocol"*

**What it means:**
- Protocol owns the iAERO/AERO liquidity pool
- Sell your iAERO directly without searching for buyers
- No 4-year lock, no waiting periods

**User benefit:**
- Exit whenever you need capital
- No price discovery issues
- No dependence on DEX liquidity depth

**Soundbite:** *"Locked veAERO? That's so 2023. Welcome to liquidity."*

---

### 4. 🔥 The Exit Liquidity Flywheel (THE KILLER FEATURE)
**Tagline:** *"Every seller makes you richer"*

**What it means:**
- When users sell iAERO, the protocol buys it back
- Protocol does NOT stake the purchased iAERO
- Same rewards distributed among fewer stakers
- Your APR increases automatically

**The Math:**
```
Scenario: 1000 AERO worth of rewards per epoch

Before sale:
- 100 stakers share 1000 AERO
- Each gets 10 AERO (10% APR)

After 20 users sell:
- 80 stakers share same 1000 AERO  
- Each gets 12.5 AERO (12.5% APR)
- That's a 25% yield boost from sellers
```

**User benefit:**
- You profit from "paper hands"
- More deposits + more sellers = compounding APR
- Natural churn works IN YOUR FAVOR
- Already delivering substantially higher yields than standard veAERO

**Soundbite:** *"In most protocols, dilution kills yields. Here, sellers boost them. We built it backwards."*

**Why this is revolutionary:**
This inverts the traditional liquid staking problem. Usually:
- More users = rewards split more ways = lower APR ❌

With iAERO:
- More users deposit → Some sell for liquidity → Protocol accumulates unstaked iAERO → Higher APR for remaining stakers ✅

---

### 5. 💎 LIQ Token Flywheel
**Tagline:** *"The same magic, now for governance"*

**What it means:**
- LIQ tokens use identical mechanics
- Sellers concentrate yields among holders
- Diamond hands are rewarded structurally

**User benefit:**
- Dual flywheel effect (iAERO + LIQ)
- LIQ becomes more valuable to hold over time
- Early adopters benefit most

**Soundbite:** *"Stake LIQ, watch sellers pump your yields. It's that simple."*

---

### 6. 📈 stiAERO - Borrow Against Your Yield
**Tagline:** *"Stake once, earn twice"*

**What it means:**
- Stake iAERO → Receive stiAERO receipt token
- Use stiAERO as collateral in lending protocols
- Keep earning full staking rewards while borrowing

**Current status:**
- ✅ stiAERO is LIVE
- 🔄 Lending protocol integration coming Q1 2026

**User benefit:**
- Capital efficiency maximized
- Borrow without unstaking
- Loop strategies possible (3-5x yield potential)
- Access liquidity without sacrificing rewards

**Advanced strategies enabled:**
1. **Leverage loop:** Stake iAERO → Borrow against stiAERO → Buy more iAERO → Repeat
2. **Delta-neutral:** Borrow stables, hedge position, capture yield spread
3. **Liquidity access:** Need capital? Borrow instead of selling

**Soundbite:** *"Your staked position just became a yield-generating credit line."*

## The Complete Value Stack

When you hold staked iAERO, you get:

1. ✅ **Optimized voting rewards** (automated)
2. ✅ **Trading fees** from voted pools
3. ✅ **Bribes** from protocols
4. ✅ **LIQ emissions** (bonus token)
5. ✅ **APR boosts** from seller exits (unique to iAERO)
6. ✅ **Exit liquidity** whenever you need it
7. ✅ **Borrowing power** via stiAERO (coming soon)

**No other veAERO position offers all of this.**

## Real Performance Data

As of 25th Nov 2025

- Current iAERO staker APR: 39%
- LIQ staking yield: 11.7% 
- Standard veAERO APR: 26% (veAERO Maxi relay)
- Yield advantage: +14.67% (after normalising LIQ yield for $ relative notional)

## Why This Works (The Economics)

### Traditional Liquid Staking Problem:
```
Protocol stakes everything → More users = More stakers → Same rewards split more ways → APR decreases
```

### iAERO Solution:
```
Users deposit → Get iAERO → Some sell (need liquidity) → Protocol buys but DOESN'T stake → 
Same rewards → Fewer stakers → APR increases
```

### The Sustainable Model:
- Not a ponzi - no external dependencies
- Works because of natural liquidity needs
- Protocol accumulates value (unstaked iAERO)
- Long-term stakers rewarded structurally
- More deposits = more potential yield concentration

## Key Objections & Responses

### "Sounds too good to be true"
**Response:** "It's just math. When someone sells, we don't stake what we buy back. Same rewards, fewer stakers. Check the contracts - it's all on-chain and verifiable."

### "What if everyone stakes forever?"
**Response:** "Then you get base veAERO yields plus optimal voting - still great. But realistically, people need liquidity. We've already seen 10% of users sell, proving natural churn exists."

### "How is this sustainable?"
**Response:** "We're not paying from reserves or printing tokens. The mechanism is: people deposit → some need exit liquidity → we provide it → their yield gets redistributed. It's concentration mechanics, not inflation."

### "Why haven't others done this?"
**Response:** "They didn't own their liquidity pool or they stake everything they buy. We designed the tokenomics specifically to create this flywheel effect."
