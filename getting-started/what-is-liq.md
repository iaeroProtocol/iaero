# What is LIQ?

## The Governance Token of iAERO

LIQ (Liquid) is the native governance and value accrual token of the iAERO protocol. It's designed to align long-term stakeholders with protocol success through voting rights and revenue sharing.

## Token Purpose

### 1. Protocol Revenue Sharing
LIQ stakers receive 8% of all protocol revenues (80% of the treasury's 10% share). This creates a direct value flow from protocol usage to LIQ holders.

### 2. Governance Rights
LIQ holders vote on critical protocol decisions:
- Fee parameters
- Treasury allocation
- Strategic partnerships
- Protocol upgrades
- Voting strategy adjustments

### 3. Incentive Alignment
Early participants receive higher LIQ emissions, rewarding early adoption and long-term commitment to the protocol.

## How to Earn LIQ

### Primary Distribution: Mining Rewards
When you deposit AERO into iAERO, you receive LIQ tokens as a bonus:
- **Starting Rate**: 1 LIQ per 1 iAERO minted
- **Halving Schedule**: Rate cuts in half every 5M LIQ minted
- **Your Share**: 80% (20% goes to treasury)

**Example Deposit:**
- Deposit: 1,000 AERO
- Receive: 950 iAERO (after 5% fee)
- Bonus: 950 LIQ (at 1:1 rate)
- Net to you: 760 LIQ (after 20% treasury share)

### Liquidity Provision Incentives (Coming Soon)

iAERO/AERO Pool Rewards Program
We're launching a dedicated incentive program for iAERO/AERO liquidity providers to ensure deep, stable liquidity.
Dual Reward Structure:

LIQ Emissions: Direct LIQ rewards for LP stakers (separate from deposit emissions)
Trading Fee Boost: Protocol-funded bribes to the iAERO/AERO gauge

How It Works:

Add liquidity to iAERO/AERO pool on Aerodrome
Stake your LP tokens in our incentive contract
Earn LIQ rewards on top of normal trading fees
Protocol votes for its own pool, directing emissions

Planned Incentive Rates:

Initial: 10,000 LIQ per week distributed pro-rata to LPs
Decreases by 10% monthly to find sustainable equilibrium
Minimum 1,000 LIQ per week floor

Why This Matters:

Better Pricing: Deeper liquidity = less slippage
Peg Stability: More liquidity helps maintain iAERO/AERO ratio
Additional Yield: Stack LP fees + AERO emissions + LIQ rewards
Protocol Growth: Liquid markets attract more users

Target Metrics:

$5M+ TVL in iAERO/AERO pool
<2% price impact on $100k swaps
Daily volume >$500k

Launch Timeline:
4-6 weeks after protocol launch, once initial liquidity established
This creates a sustainable liquidity flywheel where the protocol directly incentivizes its most important trading pair, ensuring users can always enter and exit positions efficiently.

## LIQ Tokenomics

### Supply Cap: 100 Million
Total Supply: 100,000,000 LIQ
├── Community Mining: 60,000,000 (40%)
├── Treasury Vesting: 10,000,000 (10%)
├── Team Vesting: 10,000,000 (10%)
├── Investor Vesting: 20,000,000 (20%)
└── Unallocated Reserve: 20,000,000 (20%)

### Emission Schedule

| LIQ Minted | Rate | Per iAERO | Estimated Time |
|------------|------|-----------|----------------|
| 0-5M | 1.0x | 1.000 | Months 0-3 |
| 5-10M | 0.5x | 0.500 | Months 3-8 |
| 10-15M | 0.25x | 0.250 | Months 8-18 |
| 15-20M | 0.125x | 0.125 | Months 18-36 |
| 20-25M | 0.0625x | 0.0625 | Years 3-5 |

### Why Halvings Matter
- **Decreasing Inflation**: Supply growth slows over time
- **Early Advantage**: First movers get most LIQ per dollar
- **Scarcity**: Later users compete for fewer tokens

## Value Accrual Mechanisms

### Direct Revenue Flow
Protocol Fees (10% of all rewards)
└→ TreasuryDistributor
├→ 80% to LIQ stakers (8% of total)
└→ 20% to Treasury ops (2% of total)

### What LIQ Stakers Earn
- AERO tokens
- USDC from bribes
- ETH from fees
- Various protocol tokens
- Any future protocol revenues

### Staking LIQ
1. Stake LIQ in dedicated staking contract
2. Earn proportional share of revenues
3. Claim rewards anytime
4. No lock period required

3. Earlier deposits = more LIQ per AERO

### Option 2: Buy on Market

- **Aggregators**: Use Matcha, 1inch for best price
- **OTC**: Large trades via Discord

### Option 3: Liquidity Provision
- Provide liquidity to iAERO or LIQ pairs
- Earn trading fees + potential emissions
