## Maximizing veAERO Efficiency Through Permalocked Liquidity

iAERO is a liquid staking protocol for Aerodrome Finance that enables users to maintain liquidity while earning optimised voting rewards through permanently locked veAERO positions.

### Core Benefits

🔒 **Maximum Voting Power** - Vault maintains permanently locked veAERO for maximum rewards  
💧 **Stay Liquid** - Receive tradeable iAERO tokens representing your deposit  
🎁 **Dual Rewards** - Earn both LIQ emissions and staking rewards  
⚡ **Auto-Compounding** - Vault automatically manages and optimizes positions  
🗳️ **Automated Voting** - Smart allocation system optimizes votes across all gauges  
🤖 **Set & Forget** - No weekly voting, no rebase management, no manual claiming  

### The "Cake and Eat It Too" Protocol

Remember when your parents said you can't have your cake and eat it too? Well, they never met iAERO.

**Traditional veAERO:** Lock for 4 years, lose access to capital, vote every week, or watch your voting power decay faster than your New Year's resolutions.

**iAERO:** Deposit once, stay liquid forever, let the robots handle the voting while you sleep. It's like hiring a personal assistant for your veAERO, except this one actually shows up to work.

### Why Liquid Staking Beats Locking

| The Old Way (veAERO) | The iAERO Way |
|----------------------|---------------|
| 🔐 Lock for 4 years | 💧 Stay liquid always |
| 📉 Voting power decays | 📈 Vault maintains max lock |
| 🗓️ Vote every week manually | 🤖 Automated optimal voting |
| 😴 Miss votes = lose rewards | 💰 Never miss rewards again |
| 🔧 Rebase every 3 months | ⚙️ Auto-rebasing by keeper |
| 🏝️ Can't vote on vacation | 🌴 Earn while you sleep |

### The Math That Makes You Rich(er)

**Solo Locking:** You lock 1000 AERO, vote when you remember, probably miss 30% of epochs because life happens.

**iAERO Chad Move:** 
- Deposit 1000 AERO → Get 950 iAERO (5% fee)
- Earn from 100% of epochs (robots don't sleep)
- Get bonus LIQ tokens (emissions halve over time - early = good)
- Your voting power compounds with everyone else's
- Trade iAERO if you need liquidity

### Automated Voting: The Secret Sauce

Our voting manager doesn't just vote - it votes *optimally*:

1. **Scans all gauge bribes** - Finds where the money is
2. **Calculates ROI per pool** - Math nerds rejoice
3. **Allocates proportionally** - More bribes = more votes
4. **Executes flawlessly** - Every. Single. Week.
5. **You do nothing** - This is the best part

### The "But Wait, There's More" Section

🎰 **No Impermanent Loss** - This isn't an LP position  
📊 **Transparent Metrics** - All votes and rewards on-chain  
🏛️ **Battle-Tested veNFT Tech** - Built on Aerodrome's proven systems  
🔄 **Instant Entry/Exit** - No waiting periods for iAERO trading  
💎 **LIQ Governance Token** - Because one token wasn't enough  
🛡️ **Multi-sig Protected** - Your funds are SAFU  

### Real Talk: Who Is This For?

✅ **Perfect for:**
- AERO holders who want voting rewards without the lock
- Degens who can't commit to 4 years of anything
- Protocols wanting liquid veAERO exposure
- Anyone who forgets to vote (so, everyone)

❌ **Not for:**
- People who enjoy manual weekly voting
- Masochists who like locked tokens
- Anyone allergic to yields

### The TL;DR

iAERO turns your AERO into a yield-generating, liquid, auto-voting machine. You get the max voting rewards of a 4-year lock without the 4-year lock. The vault does all the work, you collect all the rewards (minus a tiny fee because we need to eat too).
