# iAERO Documentation
## Maximizing veAERO Efficiency Through Permalocked Liquidity

iAERO is a liquid staking protocol for Aerodrome Finance that enables users to maintain liquidity while earning optimised voting rewards through permanently locked veAERO positions.

### Core Benefits

🔒 **Maximum Voting Power** - Vault maintains permanently locked veAERO for maximum rewards  
💧 **Stay Liquid** - Receive tradeable iAERO tokens representing your deposit  
🎁 **Dual Rewards** - Earn both LIQ emissions and staking rewards  
⚡ **Auto-Compounding** - Vault automatically manages and optimizes positions  
🗳️ **Automated Voting** - Smart allocation system optimizes votes across all gauges  
🤖 **Set & Forget** - No weekly voting, no rebase management, no manual claiming  

### The "Cake and Eat It Too" Protocol

Remember when your parents said you can't have your cake and eat it too? Well, they never met iAERO.

**Traditional veAERO:** Lock for 4 years, lose access to capital, vote every week, or watch your voting power decay faster than your New Year's resolutions.

**iAERO:** Deposit once, stay liquid forever, let the robots handle the voting while you sleep. It's like hiring a personal assistant for your veAERO, except this one actually shows up to work.

### Why Liquid Staking Beats Locking

| The Old Way (veAERO) | The iAERO Way |
|----------------------|---------------|
| 🔐 Lock for 4 years | 💧 Stay liquid always |
| 📉 Voting power decays | 📈 Vault maintains max lock |
| 🗓️ Vote every week manually | 🤖 Automated optimal voting |
| 😴 Miss votes = lose rewards | 💰 Never miss rewards again |
| 🔧 Rebase every week | ⚙️ Auto-rebasing by keeper |
| 🏝️ Can't vote on vacation | 🌴 Earn while you sleep |

### The Math That Makes You Rich(er)

**Solo Locking:** You lock 1000 AERO, vote when you remember, probably miss 30% of epochs because life happens.

**iAERO Chad Move:** 
- Deposit 1000 AERO → Get 950 iAERO (5% fee)
- Earn from 100% of epochs (robots don't sleep)
- Get bonus LIQ tokens (emissions halve over time - early = good)
- Your voting power compounds with everyone else's
- Trade iAERO if you need liquidity

### Automated Voting: The Secret Sauce

Our voting manager doesn't just vote - it votes *optimally*:

1. **Scans all gauge bribes** - Finds where the money is
2. **Calculates ROI per pool** - Math nerds rejoice
3. **Allocates proportionally** - More bribes = more votes
4. **Executes flawlessly** - Every. Single. Week.
5. **You do nothing** - This is the best part

### The "But Wait, There's More" Section

🎰 **No Impermanent Loss** - This isn't an LP position  
📊 **Transparent Metrics** - All votes and rewards on-chain  
🏛️ **Battle-Tested veNFT Tech** - Built on Aerodrome's proven systems  
🔄 **Instant Entry/Exit** - No waiting periods for iAERO trading  
💎 **LIQ Governance Token** - Because one token wasn't enough  
🛡️ **Multi-sig Protected** - Your funds are SAFU  

### Real Talk: Who Is This For?

✅ **Perfect for:**
- AERO holders who want voting rewards without the lock
- Degens who can't commit to 4 years of anything
- Protocols wanting liquid veAERO exposure
- Anyone who forgets to vote (so, everyone)

❌ **Not for:**
- People who enjoy manual weekly voting
- Masochists who like locked tokens
- Anyone allergic to yields

### The TL;DR

iAERO turns your AERO into a yield-generating, liquid, auto-voting machine. You get the max voting rewards of a 4-year lock without the 4-year lock. The vault does all the work, you collect all the rewards (minus a tiny fee because we need to eat too).

### Join the Revolution

Stop choosing between liquidity and yields. With iAERO, you're not just staking - you're upgrading to Staking 2.0.

*Disclaimer: No actual cakes were harmed in the making of this protocol. Past performance doesn't guarantee future results, but our robots are pretty good at their job.*

### 🚀 Coming Soon: Next-Level DeFi Composability

#### Staked iAERO Receipt Tokens (stiAERO)

We're launching **stiAERO** - a receipt token for staked iAERO that unlocks a whole new world of capital efficiency.

**What This Means For You:**

🏦 **Borrow Against Your Staking Position**
- Use stiAERO as collateral in lending markets
- Access liquidity without unstaking or losing rewards
- Keep earning while your tokens work as collateral

💰 **Ultimate Capital Efficiency**
- Stack yields: staking rewards + lending/borrowing strategies
- Loop strategies: Borrow → Buy more iAERO → Stake → Repeat
- Never choose between earning and liquidity again

🔄 **Tradeable Staking Positions**
- Sell your staking position without unstaking
- Buy pre-staked positions from others
- Create secondary markets for yield-bearing tokens

📈 **Enhanced Yield Strategies**
- **Delta-neutral farming**: Borrow stables against stiAERO
- **Leveraged staking**: Borrow iAERO to increase position
- **Yield arbitrage**: Borrow when rates < staking APR

🎯 **Real Use Cases**
- Need quick liquidity? Borrow against stiAERO instead of unstaking
- Want more exposure? Loop your position for up to 3-5x rewards
- Market downturn? Borrow stables without selling your stack

**The Power of Composability:**

Your Journey: AERO → iAERO → stiAERO → Collateral → Loan → More Yield

Deposit AERO, get iAERO (liquid)
Stake iAERO, get stiAERO (still liquid!)
Use stiAERO as collateral
Borrow against it
Still earn full staking rewards
Use loan for anything you want

**Why This Changes Everything:**

Traditional staking locks your capital in one place. With stiAERO, your capital works in multiple protocols simultaneously:
- ✅ Earning in iAERO staking
- ✅ Serving as collateral
- ✅ Enabling borrowing power
- ✅ Remaining liquid and tradeable

**Expected Launch**: Q1 2025

**Supported Platforms** (Planned):
- Native iAERO lending market
- Morpho Finance integration
- Other Aerodrome ecosystem lending protocols

This isn't just an upgrade - it's a complete reimagining of what staked assets can do. Get ready to put your iAERO to work in ways you never imagined.
